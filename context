Context 1: Albert Einstein
Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. Einstein is best known for his mass-energy equivalence formula, E=mc², which has been dubbed "the world’s most famous equation." He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to theoretical physics, particularly his discovery of the photoelectric effect, a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.

Context 2: The Amazon Rainforest
The Amazon Rainforest, also known as Amazonia, is a vast tropical rainforest in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon Basin of South America. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations. The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with Peru having the second-largest portion. The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world. The Amazon is home to an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species.

2.How many nations have territory within the Amazon Rainforest?
3.Which country contains the majority of the Amazon Rainforest?
4.How many species of trees are in the Amazon?

Context 3: World War II
World War II was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved the vast majority of the world's nations, including all the great powers, eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries. In a state of "total war," the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources.

1.When did World War II begin and end?
2.How many people were directly involved in World War II?
3.What were the two opposing military alliances in World War II?
4.What is the term used to describe the war where participants use all available resources?

Context 4: Python Programming Language
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than in languages such as C++ or Java. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. It has a large standard library and an active community that contributes to a wide range of modules and frameworks.

2.When was Python first released?
3.What are some programming paradigms supported by Python?
4.Why is Python known for its readability?

Context 5: The Solar System
The Solar System consists of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the remainder being smaller objects such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. The Solar System also contains a wide variety of moons, with some planets having many moons. The four inner planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are known as the terrestrial planets, being composed primarily of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, substantially more massive than the terrestrials.
